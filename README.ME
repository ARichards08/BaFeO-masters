This is the code for my final year project at University. It creates a unit cell file of a molecule of barium hexaferrite in cartesian coordinates from a set of wyckoff positions, and outputs this data into
a text file that is formatted so that VAMPIRE atomistic simulations can be run on it.

All f90 programs compiled using this command with * being the file name:

gfortran -Wall -O3 -std=f2003 -o *.exe *.f90

In bug testing the flags are used:
-O0 -Wall -std=f2003 -fcheck=all -fbacktrace
